- topic.php:
	- Access first 10 pages of posts on first php load.
	
	- Implement Javascript to be able to move through them.
	
	- Loading 10 pages isn't too expensive.
	
	- Upon accessing any arbitrary page, load the 10 closest pages.
		ex. If the user chooses to view page 10, pages 6 - 15 will also be loaded.
			
	- Javascript would make for a much more fluid user experience. Way fewer loads
		when browsing posts rapidly.
			
	- This site could be like 4chan, but without all the excessive scrolling
		required to read posts. Instead, button pressing.
	
	- If a user uploads an image, only display the thumbnail until the user interacts with it.
	
- login/registration:
	- We need to discuss brute force countermeasures. Currently, if a user has 5 failed log in attempts,
		their account is locked, with 5 rows added to the "flood" table, one for each attempt.
		Their account will be locked until the rows are cleared. This seems kind of annoying, but
		I don't know if it is necessary or not.
	
	- We should add a registration email loop. Shouldn't be too hard.

- Header/Footer/Titlebar
	- All fixed positions, would help eliminate excessive scrolling.
	- One of the things I hate about facebook/4chan is that so much fucking scrolling is needed to see content.
